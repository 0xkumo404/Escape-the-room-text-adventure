# Escape-the-room-text-adventure
A C++ text adventure. This is a basic game I developted in my learing of C++. I have not used it very much and wanted to share it with the world.

To play the game just copy the file contence from the file I have here and then compile the file in terminal (g++ escape.cpp -o Start_Escape). Then just run the compiled file (./Start_Escape). IMPORTANT NOTE: Do NOT I repeat do NOT read the file contence if you do not want spoilers on the passwords to the game! Although if you need some help you can look at a little bit of the code if you need.

I had fun making this and I hope you have as much fun as I had creating. Don't be afraid to spend time writing code and make big projects, just go at it and work hard. You can achieve your coding dreams with a little hard work (... and a little bit of google).

Message me if you enjoyed this game so that I know people like my stuff.
